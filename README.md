# RecyclingSimulation
The simulation shows Recycling plastic according to Plastics Identification Chart implemented on ARENA Simulation software.

As there are many types of plastic some of them can be recycled and others canâ€™t be recycled so they are numbered according to their level of recycling. The simulation starts with creating samples from the received items ranging from 1-6, from 1-5 enters the recycling process block and the last one enters the bad process block which cannot be recycled. They all go through a decision block if it recycled moves to the final step otherwise it goes through another block that tries advanced recycling on them and 75% of them fail to be recycled and 25% succeed.
